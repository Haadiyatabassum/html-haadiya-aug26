   <p style="color:green;">
      
	  Advancements in space technology have accelerated dramatically in recent years, marked by innovations that push the boundaries of exploration<br> 
	  and commercialization. Private companies, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, have revolutionized space travel with reusable rockets, significantly<br>
	  reducing the cost of access to space. Meanwhile, advancements in satellite technology are enhancing global communications, Earth observation,<br>
	  and navigation systems. The development of more sophisticated propulsion systems, such as ion drives and nuclear thermal propulsion,<br>
	  promises faster and more efficient space travel, potentially reducing travel time to distant planets.<br>
